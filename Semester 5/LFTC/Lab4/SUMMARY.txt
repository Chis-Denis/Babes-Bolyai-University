Lab 4 Summary
==============

SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED ALL REQUIREMENTS

✓ Requirement 1: Defined AF (Finite Automata) for identifiers and constants
✓ Requirement 2: Implemented transformation of RG to AF (Theorem 1)
✓ Requirement 2: Check if input sequence is accepted by the FA
✓ Integration: Linked Lab 4 to Lab 3 (replaced regex with FA)

Files Created:
--------------
1. finite_automata.py - FA implementation with conversion functions
2. lexer_fa.py - Modified lexer using FA instead of regex
3. documentation.txt - Comprehensive explanation of automata
4. README.md - Quick start guide
5. SUMMARY.txt - This file

Test Results:
-------------
✓ Identifier FA correctly recognizes valid identifiers
✓ Integer FA correctly recognizes valid integers  
✓ FA-based lexer produces IDENTICAL output to Lab 3's regex-based lexer
✓ Error detection works correctly (e.g., "1b" is rejected)

Verification:
-------------
- PIF.txt matches Lab 3 output exactly
- ST.txt matches Lab 3 output exactly  
- Errors.txt shows correct error detection

Theoretical Achievement:
------------------------
Successfully demonstrated the equivalence between:
  Regular Expressions ⟷ Regular Grammars ⟷ Finite Automata

All three formalisms recognize the same languages for identifiers and integers.

Ready for submission!
