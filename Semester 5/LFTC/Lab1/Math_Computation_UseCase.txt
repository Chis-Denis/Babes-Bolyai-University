Math Computation DSL - Use Case and Choice of Statements


Overview
The Math Computation DSL is a domain-specific language designed to support integer and string-based mathematical computation through simple and expressive syntax.
This section presents the statements defined in the language, explaining their purpose and providing examples of use.


1. Declaration Statement
Syntax:
    int x = 10
    str name = "Alice"
    array<int> nums

Purpose:
    Declares variables of basic or composed types (int, str, char, array<T>) to store and manipulate data.

Example:
    int a = 5
    int b = 3
    OUTPUT a + b
# Declares two integers used later for arithmetic operations.


2. Assignment Statement
Syntax:
    identifier = expression

Purpose:
    Updates an existing variable with a new value.

Justification:
    Needed for dynamic computations, iterative updates, and state changes inside loops or functions.

Example:
    int x = 0
    x = x + 1
    OUTPUT x
# Updates the value of x and prints it.


3. INPUT Statement
Syntax:
    INPUT variable

Purpose:
    Reads a value from the user and stores it in a variable.

Justification:
    Allows user interaction and dynamic program behavior.

Example:
    int n
    INPUT n
    OUTPUT "You entered:" n
# Reads an integer n from the console and prints it.


4. OUTPUT Statement
Syntax:
    OUTPUT expression

Purpose:
    Displays computed results or text to the user.

Justification:
    Essential for observing program output and verifying computations.

Example:
    OUTPUT "Sum of numbers:"
    OUTPUT a + b
# Prints both a string message and a computed result.



5. IF - THEN - ELSE - END Statement
Syntax:
    IF condition THEN
        statement_list
    ELSE
        statement_list
    END

Purpose:
    Performs conditional branching - executes code only if a condition holds true.

Justification:
    Enables decision-making in computations (e.g., comparing numbers, selecting formulas).

Example:
    IF a > b THEN
        OUTPUT "a is greater"
    ELSE
        OUTPUT "b is greater or equal"
    END
# Compares two integers and prints the correct message.



6. WHILE - DO - END Statement
Syntax:
    WHILE condition DO
        statement_list
    END

Purpose:
    Executes a set of statements repeatedly while the condition is true.

Justification:
    Used for iteration, e.g., repeating calculations, filling arrays, etc.

Example:
    int i = 0
    WHILE i < 3 DO
        OUTPUT i
        i = i + 1
    END
# Prints numbers from 0 to 2.



7. DEF - BEGIN - END (Function Definition)
Syntax:
    DEF name(parameters)
    BEGIN
        statement_list
    END

Purpose:
    Defines a reusable computation block (function) that can be called multiple times.

Justification:
    Encourages modular programming - separating logic into reusable, callable components.

Example:
    DEF sum(x, y)
    BEGIN
        RETURN x + y
    END
# Defines a function sum that returns the addition of two numbers.



8. RETURN Statement
Syntax:
    RETURN expression

Purpose:
    Specifies the result to be sent back from a function.

Justification:
    Allows functions to produce output values for reuse elsewhere in the program.

Example:
    DEF gcd(x, y)
    BEGIN
        RETURN x ^^ y
    END
# Returns the greatest common divisor of two numbers.



9. Array Access Statement
Syntax:
    array_name[index] = expression
    OUTPUT array_name[index]

Purpose:
    Stores or retrieves data in a composed structure (array).

Justification:
    Required for handling collections of values and performing indexed computations.

Example:
    array<int> values
    int i = 0
    WHILE i < 3 DO
        values[i] = i * 2
        i = i + 1
    END
    OUTPUT values[1]
# Demonstrates dynamic array usage with a loop.



10. Domain-Specific Operators
Syntax:
    a ^^ b    # GCD
    a %% b    # LCM
    a @@ b    # Power Sum

Purpose:
    Provide direct computation for common mathematical operations in number theory.

Justification:
    These operators make the DSL domain-specific - simplifying otherwise complex operations into one symbol.

Example:
    int a = 12
    int b = 8
    OUTPUT "GCD:" a ^^ b
    OUTPUT "LCM:" a %% b
    OUTPUT "Power Sum:" a @@ b
# Demonstrates mathematical operators specialized for this DSL.



11. Expression Statement
Syntax:
    expression

Purpose:
    Allows a simple expression to be executed as a standalone statement (e.g., function call).

Justification:
    Useful for concise syntax when a return value isn’t needed.

Example:
    sum(a, b)
# Calls the function sum without storing or printing its result.
