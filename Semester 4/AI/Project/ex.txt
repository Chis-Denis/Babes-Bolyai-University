1. Rastrigin Function
Boxplot Analysis
All four configurations (real-arithmetic, real-blx, binary-1point, binary-2point) achieve low best fitness values, with medians close to zero.
Spread (variance):
All methods show some spread, but the real-valued and binary encodings perform similarly.
Outliers are present in all configurations, indicating that in a few runs, the GA did not find the global minimum.
Median:
The median best fitness is very close to zero for all, suggesting that most runs successfully found or approached the global minimum.
No configuration is dramatically better than the others, but you might see slightly less spread for real-blx and binary-1point.
Interpretation
All GA configurations are effective at minimizing the Rastrigin function.
Occasional outliers suggest that the GA can sometimes get stuck in local minima, which is expected for a highly multimodal function like Rastrigin.
No clear winner: All methods are robust, but you could check the printed means and standard deviations for a more precise ranking.
2. Himmelblau Function
Boxplot Analysis
real-blx and binary-1point have the lowest medians and the tightest boxes, indicating very consistent and successful optimization.
real-arithmetic and binary-2point show slightly higher medians and more spread, with a few outliers.
Outliers are present, but less frequent and less severe than for Rastrigin.
Interpretation
real-blx crossover (real-valued encoding) and binary-1point crossover (binary encoding) are the most reliable for Himmelblau, consistently finding the global minimum.
real-arithmetic and binary-2point are still effective but slightly less consistent.
Overall, the GA is very effective for Himmelblau, with most runs achieving near-zero best fitness.
Statistical Significance
The t-tests and ANOVA you ran (see terminal output) will tell you if the differences between configurations are statistically significant.
If p-values are less than 0.05, the differences are significant; otherwise, they are not.
Summary Table Example (based on your results)
| Function | Encoding | Crossover | Mean Best Fitness | Std. Dev. | Notes |
|-------------|------------|-------------|-------------------|-----------|------------------------------|
| Rastrigin | Real | Arithmetic | ~0.9 | ~1.0 | All configs similar, some outliers |
| Rastrigin | Real | BLX | ~0.9 | ~1.0 | |
| Rastrigin | Binary | 1-point | ~0.9 | ~1.0 | |
| Rastrigin | Binary | 2-point | ~0.9 | ~1.0 | |
| Himmelblau | Real | Arithmetic | Slightly higher | | More spread, some outliers |
| Himmelblau | Real | BLX | Near zero | Very low | Most consistent |
| Himmelblau | Binary | 1-point | Near zero | Very low | Most consistent |
| Himmelblau | Binary | 2-point | Slightly higher | | More spread, some outliers |
Conclusions
All GA configurations are effective for both functions, but some are more consistent.
For Himmelblau, real-blx and binary-1point are the most robust.
For Rastrigin, all methods are similar, but outliers are more common due to the functionâ€™s complexity.
Statistical tests confirm whether observed differences are significant.
